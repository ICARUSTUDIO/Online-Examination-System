Then select the JAR file suitable for your JDK version and add it to your Project Libraries. in the auth folder of the MSSQL JDBC Extract copy the authentication dll and past it in you JDK bin folder, and ensure that it is specified in your System Path.
2.    To add to System Path copy the directory where the auth.dll is located e.g "C:\Program Files\sqljdbc_12.8\enu\auth\x64\mssql-jdbc_auth-12.8.0.x64.dll" Open your search bar and search for Environment Variables, click on the "Environment Variables button at the buttom and in the new dialogue boc look for path(click on path and then click new then paste the directory in it click Ok then close); might need to restart pc.
